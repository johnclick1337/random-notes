# Random Notes & Snippets

A disorganized collection of thoughts, code snippets, quick reminders, and ideas about various tech topics, personal projects, and learning resources. This is my digital scratchpad for anything that doesn't have a fixed home.

TODO List:
- [ ] Explore new cybersecurity tools
- [ ] Finish Python project
- [ ] Read up on cloud security
- [ ] Plan next blog post
- [ ] Research new JavaScript frameworks (maybe Svelte or Vue.js?)
- [ ] Set up a local K8s environment for testing
- [ ] Look into Raspberry Pi projects for home automation
